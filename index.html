      <p>Because you can see how it's been there for a really long time and there's random areas where in the midst of ancient old houses, suddenly new apartments and houses will shoot up in the landscape. And there's a lot of dichotomy differences between the old architecture and the new. Even though I can tell how new architecture takes into account the cultural background. You can tell it's influenced by Korean culture, but it's so different.

      <span class="question">Crazy in a good way or a bad way?</span>
        <p>Both. I'm Korean American so my experience is really different from native Koreans and foreigners because for all my foreigner friends who I studied abroad with, they came in and experienced Korea as a tourist. Because Korea is such a homogenous society, if you look like a foreigner you'll be treated like a foreigner. Sometimes they'll be nicer, other times more racist/xenophobic. They're able to go in and see all the great fun and culture which is amazing and great but the extent to which you see bad things isn't as much because people don't up-front show it to you.<br /><br />

        It was different because there was an expectation for me, and I didn't fill that. Just because not a lot of people have met people like me and had expectation for me. I got a lot of rude questions like "why didn't your parents teach you this better." It's different. The boundaries are different. </p>

    I walked everywhere. I would walk from my dorm to Hongdae, the music and arts street culture area. I would go there a couple times every week. A couple times more than is socially acceptable. Especially because I would go alone to explore and see all the things I wanted to look at. And take my time. I would go there all the time and walk back when it was super late, and there would be street shows going on.
    <br /><br />
    I never expected that there would be so much of it. I think it's called busking, where young people will go city to city, play music there, connect with the people there, and then go to the next.

    <h3>There was this one guy who was in his early 20s and I was never able to get his name.</h3>
    <p>He said he'd been busking from Busan and to all the big countries and this was his last trip before going back. He would always say, "I've been hopping around like a frog from city to city." I thought that was really funny. He was saying he really liked it in Seoul and the atmosphere was the best. You see a lot of people like that and it's really cool.</p>

    <h3>The piano is always at the mouth of the main street, a popular place for couples and young people to hang out.</h3>
    <p>That night I had gone and watched a movie, because that's what you do in a big lonely city filled with people... you go and watch movies.
      <br /><br />
    I went through that street to go to my dorm. There was a little crowd and this guy playing piano, so I stopped to watch. He went through a couple of songs and there was this lady wearing entirely pink and an older man was telling her how this street used to be the area where new music was happening and artists would come to live together and hang out. And much of that has changed in the past couple of decades. Now there's still lots of musical performances, but the old spirit kind of moved on from that place. And that's why I loved this midnight performance so much. It was kind of like the last echoes of the era... fading away into the night.</p>

    <h3>There was this one guy in his mid to late 30s and he played in a park.</h3>
    <p>And he only played oldies, but the coolest thing was that he would take requests and people would just shout them out and he would start playing them. And you could tell he was just quickly making it up as he went along. I think he was one of my favorites, and it was cool to recognize some of the songs because it's music my parents listened to.

    That was nice. The echo of the Korea that I knew when I was little...</p>
